## ECE 452 - App Proposal

# Memoir - A Photo Journaling and Sharing App

### TL;DR
At the end of the day it shows you the photos you took and you annotate it with what you were doing to create a photo journal.

### Explanation by Example
- At 10pm you get a notification reminding you to review your photos. You tap it.
- You are shown a screenshot you took of a code you needed to remember. 
    - You decide you don't need it anymore so you choose to delete it.
- You are shown a photo you took of your roommate eating cookies you baked together.
    - You annotate the photo with a few sentences about the experience.
    - You tag your friend in the photo.
    - You add it to your friend group's shared album.
- The app syncs the photos in your shared album to your friends' phones.

### Driving Need
When something momentous, exciting, or amusing happens, I often capture it in a quick photo. When I scroll back through my camera roll, it's not hard for me to imagine it as snapshots of my life (meeting new people, travelling to new places, trying new food, and spending time with people who mean a lot to me). Unfortunately, I often forget a lot of the details and when I look through my photos I feel like something is missing. In addition, I don't want to pay for lots of cloud storage but I want to share and back up my photos with my friends.

Memoir is a photo journaling app that helps you remember and share the photo-worthy moments of your life.

## Photo Organization and Sharing Features
- Annotate photos with words.
- Tag people and pets in images.
- Add photos to one or more albums.
- Sub albums/events (whatever we want to call them) because I love hierarchical storage.
- Share albums.
- Search for images based on description, people in the image, location, photographer (the things you would expect from a good photo app)

## Networking
*We pick one of these options and make the others stretch goals.*
### Local Network
- Memoir listens to and pings for a certain port on devices connected to the same local network. When Memoir finds another Memoir instance, it checks to see if the two instances share any albums and if so, syncs any changes.
### Central Server
- Since this should be a fairly simple server I don't think it would be too against the course requirements
### Relay Servers and P2P
- This is magic that I don't know much about but something like what Syncthing does.
