# Memoir

Memoir is a photo journaling app that helps you remember and share the photo-worthy moments of your life.

Photo Organization and Sharing Features
- Annotate photos with words.
- Tag people and pets in images.
- Add photos to one or more albums.
- Sub albums/events (whatever we want to call them) because I love hierarchical storage.
- Share albums.
- Search for images based on description, people in the image, location, photographer (the things you would expect from a good photo app)

- Members: Andrew Willms (Andrew-Willms), Arni Nalawade (Arni-Nalawade), Brianna Gonzalez (gonzalezbrianna), Carter Demars (carterdemars), Nathan Xie (na3th9n), Ryan Gosal (RyanGosal24)
